# Stack Overflow Survey Analysis

## About the dataset
Stack Overflow, the go-to platform for developers, conducted a global survey to capture insights into the developer community. This survey includes various questions related to professional experience, coding activities, tools, technologies, and preferences. The dataset offers important information about the current state of software development worldwide.

## About the project
* In this project, I worked with over 65k+ records to explore, analyze, and visualize trends in programming languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks. I also examined demographic trends.
* The survey data consists of responses from developers with diverse professional backgrounds, educational levels, and geographic locations.
* This project aims to provide insights into the most popular programming languages, platforms, databases and frameworks, as well as the challenges and opportunities developers face today by analyzing the survey data.

### Technologies Used:
Python, SQL, Cognos Analytics, Looker Studio, Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

### Methodologies Used:
Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Dashboards

### What this Analysis tells us:
* The analysis helped us understand the key trends in the market interest for technology usage.​
* We can conclude that there's a small shift towards more cloud based, user friendly technologies.​
* Python, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Spring Boot and AWS are leading in both current usage and future trends.​
* The demographics leans towards most developers being aged 25-34 years old (41.3%), most respondents are from USA and most of them have a Bachelor's or Master's degree.​
* It helps the developers and educators by leading them to upskill and  offer trainings for new emerging technologies and move away from traditional programs.​
